# simbian_test


This project visualizes the contrast between traditional SOC operations and an AI-powered experience with Simbian. My thought process was to make each section emotionally and visually impactfulâ€”**"Without Simbian"** simulates chaos and inefficiency with animated alert floods and rising threat counters, while **"With Simbian"** emphasizes calm, automated, and intelligent flow using horizontal progression steps and zeroed-out threat counters.

To build this, I used:
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and timeline reveals
- **react-resizable-panels** for future scalability in layout (especially for side-by-side comparisons or inspector panels)
- **shadcn/ui** components for clean, accessible UI structure
- **lucide-react** icons for modern, sharp visuals

If given more time, I would add Lottie animations, sound feedback for alert drops, dark mode support, and an interactive toggle to switch between Simbian modes instead of scrolling. I would also write tests for the alert flow logic and animation performance for production readiness.
